Thus, either this is not available in the provided sets, or it is misinterpreted within other columns. Therefore, the examination must be to decipher the needed data precisely.\\n\\nKindly double verify the loaded content formats verifying stock price info might have been compacted within columns signified differently. If not, we may need receipts encompassing such stock pricing specifics.\\n\\nLet\\'s confirm financial metrics (Income Statement/Balance Sheet) keenly hence Infrastructure seems more readily with evident closely. Subsequently, inclusive insights from cash flow aspects will consolidate an advising recommendation on Microsoft (MSFT).\\nBased on the inspection, the `file1` contains financial metrics, `file2` primarily contains cash flow data, and `file3` appears to contain both cash flow elements as well. It seems like the earlier assumption was correct.\\n\\nHowever, the first row for `file2` did indicate some historical price-related details. So, we need to revisit this dataset to ensure that data related to historical prices is correctly aligned.\\n\\n### Confirm Data Structure for Historical Prices\\nWhile examining data inputs, let\\'s affirmatively check for presence by isolating the Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume correctly for analysis effectiveness. We could then reconfirm a profile on migration from `file2`.\\n\\nLet\\'s make sure to have isolated subset analysis for column integrity given expected names will embark:\\n\\n- Date\\n- Open\\n- High\\n- Low\\n- Close\\n- Volume\\nIt appears that the dataset discussed in the previous message does not actually contain the historical stock price data but rather cash flow data. Let\\'s review the other file, which should contain the required historical stock prices.\\n\\nI will ensure the historical stock price data is correctly sourced and analyzed. The correct dataset likely resides in the other provided files. Let\\'s recheck the valid file paths and their contents.\\nIt appears that there is no column named \"Close\" in the historical prices data. Let\\'s inspect the columns of the dataset to determine the correct column names.\\n\\nI\\'ll display the column names and a few rows of the dataset to identify the columns.\\nHere are the information gathered from the financial analyst: \\n\\nThese are the stocks the client wants advice on: \\n1.
