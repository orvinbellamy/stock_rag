       "{'MRNA': ['Vaccine makers and analysts alike are still unclear about what a new fall respiratory virus market looks like in a post-pandemic world. But low uptake this season is, so far, in line with expectations.\\nFewer COVID-19 and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccines have been administered this year than were administered around the same time last year, according to a note from Jefferies analyst Michael Yee on Friday.\\nThat includes COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), which have totaled about 2.5 million doses administered weekly as of Oct. 4, up slightly from 2.4 million the week before. Meanwhile, doses of RSV vaccines, which include shots from Pfizer, Moderna, and GSK (GSK), are down 40% year over year.\\nCOVID jabs started strong at the end of August but slowed recently. Wall Street is waiting to see if there is any pickup by the holidays or if they continue to dwindle — which would signal poor sales for the year for both Moderna and Pfizer. There have been roughly 2.5 million prescriptions written for COVID vaccines, with Moderna comprising 1 million and Pfizer at 1.5 million.\\nInvestors have been closely watching vaccine sales in the post-pandemic era to understand if they will continue to contribute significantly to manufacturers\\' bottom lines and at what level they will bottom out.\\nModerna has faced the most scrutiny as it pivots away from being a single-product company, with two vaccines on the market.\\nBut Jefferies noted that Moderna\\'s vaccine market share is \"immaterial\" for RSV vaccines, as it holds less than 1% of the market. And for the COVID market, its share is about 40%, which is less than the 48% it enjoyed last year.\\nModerna was the first company to prove the mRNA technology worked during the pandemic. It recorded nearly $38 billion in sales from the COVID vaccine in 2021 and 2022 before a decline to just $6.8 billion last year. This is the company\\'s first RSV season, which lasts from September through April and typically peaks by February.\\nThe RSV market was expected to be weaker this year than last year, which was the first season with shots on the market.\\nYee wrote that the firm had predicted RSV jabs would be about 15%-20% lower than in 2023 — which had $2 billion in sales and about 10 million shots administered. The prediction for 2024 was for around 8 million shots.\\nBut six weeks into the season, there have only been 900,000 prescriptions so far, compared to 1.5 million in the same period last year, representing a 40% year-over-year decline.\\nInvestors will be waiting to see if the three companies shift their 2024 outlook in upcoming earnings calls.\\n\"There is some debate that as we enter the second year of the endemic we will see lower covid jabs in this season too, which we do expect based off commentary on demand,\" Yee wrote. \"We also saw MRNA share lower 2025 guidance and co is alluding to assumptions around lower vaccination rates in 2025.\"\\nModerna reduced its 2024 outlook from $4 billion in sales to between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Pfizer, meanwhile, raised its outlook earlier this year after several cost-cutting moves. It now expects revenue in the range of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion, up from $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion — with a combined $8.5 billion expected from the COVID vaccine and COVID treatment Paxlovid.\\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

       "  \"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's List of Stocks that Finished Dead Last.\\xa0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks that finished dead last.\\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer examined market trends of the third quarter. He first discussed that while high interest rates and a cash-strapped consumer typically signal good fortune for dollar stores, this time was different.\\nDollar stores are grappling with substantial challenges, primarily stemming from inflation. Cramer emphasized that rising prices have made it increasingly difficult for these retailers to maintain their signature one-dollar pricing model.\\nMoreover, he explained that historically, dollar stores are expected to decline when the economy improves, and that happens when the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates. However, a more pressing issue is that dollar stores are now facing more savvy consumers who have discovered better deals at larger retailers.\\nCramer went on to discuss the necessity for the stock market to be driven by new companies, rather than relying on established leaders primarily associated with artificial intelligence, which are now experiencing diminished momentum. He said:\\n“You want to find a bunch of former market darlings? I want you to take a look at the bottom of the S&P 500 for this quarter.”\\nHe remarked on the irony of the situation, suggesting that investors have spent considerable time believing that simply investing in anything linked to AI would guarantee success. He pointed out that recent market activity has shown that backing the wrong AI-related stock could lead to significant losses.\\nHe cautioned that the days of going on autopilot with the Magnificent Seven are over. Those stocks had remarkable runs earlier in the year, but Cramer insisted that it is now essential to welcome new players into the market to reach new highs.\\nLastly, he added:\\n“One thing’s certain, Wall Street, the complex of analysts, money managers, corporate finance traders, they missed out big this quarter, didn't they? They still act like the new losers will be winners soon enough while the new winners are all one-hit wonders. I say, dream on. This move could be here to stay.”\\nOur Methodology\\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 5 large stocks that underperformed during the third quarter and were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 1. We listed the stocks in descending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\\nA scientist surrounded by vials and beakers in a modern laboratory, proudly displaying a vaccine.\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\\nModerna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a biotechnology company that specializes in the development of messenger RNA therapeutics and vaccines for a variety of diseases. Its portfolio includes vaccines for respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and influenza, as well as those targeting latent infections such as HIV.\\nAdditionally, the company is involved in creating cancer treatments, including personalized vaccines, and has therapeutic options for rare diseases and pulmonary conditions.\\nDuring his show, Cramer talked about the company and said that the stock was “down nearly 44% in the third quarter.” He went on to say:\\n“Moderna simply hasn't been able to follow up with its game-changing COVID vaccine with anything big enough to move the needle.”\\nRecently, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced plans to reduce its expenses by approximately $1.1 billion by 2027, a decision driven by the decline in demand for its COVID-19-related products.\\nTo navigate this transition, the company will pause development on certain projects within its pipeline and discontinue others to better manage research and development costs. The target for R&D spending has been adjusted to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion in 2027, down from a previously forecasted $4.8 billion by the end of the current year.\\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stephane Bancel highlighted that this strategic shift will involve scaling back on some studies and putting a hold on the latent product portfolio, which pertains to viruses that can remain dormant in the body for extended periods before potentially causing serious health issues later on.\\nOverall MRNA ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer stocks that finished dead last. While we acknowledge the potential of MRNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\\n\\xa0\\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\\n\\xa0\\nDisclosure: None.

       "  'Let the good times roll. The S&P 500 has soared nearly 21% in 2024, including a 2% gain in September. What\\'s especially noteworthy is that the bull market has broadened to include more than only high-flying tech stocks.\\nHowever, not all boats are being lifted by the rising tide. Three stocks were especially hit hard last month.\\nShares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) plunged 16.8% in September. The stock is down 50% so far in 2024.\\nDollar Tree\\'s steep sell-off last month came after the discount retailer reported disappointing second-quarter results on Sept. 4. Net sales rose by only 0.7% year over year to $7.37 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 26.4% to $0.67, well below the consensus Wall Street estimate of $1.04.\\nTo add insult to injury, Dollar Tree cut its full-year 2024 guidance. The company now expects full-year net sales of between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion compared to its previous outlook of net sales in the range of $31 billion to $32 billion. Dollar Tree projects adjusted EPS between $5.20 and $5.60 versus its earlier forecast of $6.50 to $7.00.\\nCEO Rick Dreiling said in the Q2 earnings press release that the company continues to face \"immense pressures from a challenging macro environment.\" However, he argued that the customer response to Dollar Tree\\'s expanded multi-price offering has been positive at the 1,600 stores where it has been implemented. The company has thousands of other stores remaining to convert to the multi-price format.\\nShares of APA (NASDAQ: APA) sank 14.2% last month. The performance added to the oil and gas exploration company\\'s ongoing misfortunes: Its stock has plummeted around 32% year to date.\\nAPA\\'s biggest news in September was its announcement of an agreement to sell non-core assets in the Permian Basin to an undisclosed buyer for $950 million. However, most of the stock\\'s decline for the month came before this sale was announced.\\nSo what caused the stock to sink last month? APA\\'s share price was dragged down by a broader malaise in the energy sector. Oil prices fell earlier in the month, weighing on many oil and gas stocks.\\nAPA tends to be more volatile than many of its peers. Its beta coefficient is 3.24, much higher than the beta value of 0.68 for the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund.\\nModerna (NASDAQ: MRNA) earns the dubious distinction as the third worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 last month. Shares of the messenger RNA (mRNA) pioneer fell 13.7%. The biotech stock is down 33% year to date.\\nThe company\\'s research and development update on Sept. 12 served as the primary catalyst for the stock\\'s September decline. Moderna announced it was discontinuing five programs, notably including mRNA-1345, which targeted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants.\\nHowever, the news that distressed investors even more was Moderna\\'s lowering of its 2025 revenue guidance. The company now projects revenue next year of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, down from its previous forecast of revenue between $3 billion and $3.5 billion.\\nModerna also revealed that it expects to break even on an operating cash cost basis in 2028. It previously predicted it would reach break-even in 2026.\\nIs it time to buy September\\'s worth-performing S&P 500 stocks? I think it depends on your investing style.\\nValue investors who like turnaround plays could be interested in Dollar Tree. Its shares trade at below 13 times forward earnings. The company\\'s plans to explore a sale or spin-off of Family Dollar could help Dollar Tree bounce back. However, I think most investors will be better off staying on the sidelines for now with this discount retailer.\\nIncome investors who aren\\'t too risk-averse could like APA. The oil and gas company\\'s forward dividend yield hovers around 4.1%. My personal view, though, is that other energy stocks with higher yields and less volatility could be better picks than APA.\\nAggressive growth investors could find Moderna appealing. The company expects to file for regulatory approvals for 10 products through 2027, including two by the end of this year. I suspect Moderna could be a solid winner in the second half of this decade.\\nBefore you buy stock in Moderna, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Moderna wasn’t one of them.

By using mRNA-based next-generation CRC screening tests, a much smaller and less known pharma player,\\xa0Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: MYNZ), is already redefining standards in early cancer detection with its flagship colorectal cancer test ColoAlert, while also tackling cancer prevention.\\nFirst, there is the collaboration with Merck &Co Inc (NYSE: MRK). The combination of\\xa0immunotherapy blockbuster drug Keytruda from Merck and the\\xa0experimental mRNA vaccine showed encouraging results in patients diagnosed with melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. During summer, Merck and Moderna released positive mid-stage results that showed improved survival rates and showed long-lasting efficacy. Along with targeting melanoma by joining forces with Merck, Moderna is also conducting clinical trials of a cancer treatment for adults diagnosed with solid tumor cancers, lymphoma and non-small lung cancer.\\nDetermined to lead the way in cancer diagnostics, Mainz Biomed opened the week by releasing a statement to shareholders that highlighted its strategic plans,\\xa0clinical developments, and its upcoming FDA trial anticipated for 2025 which should pave the way for entry into the U.S. market.\\xa0With its innovative diagnostic solution ColoAlert that is already marketed across Europe, Mainz\\xa0Biomed\\xa0has positioned itself for substantial growth in global markets next year.\\xa0With its\\xa0flagship non-invasive test that not only revolutionized early detection of colorectal cancer but also prevention by identifying precancerous lesions, particularly advanced adenomas, Mainz Biomed reported significant clinical success in both US and European trials. Identifying these lesions allows for timely intervention through colonoscopy and adenoma removal, thereby warding off cancer from developing in the first place.\\nIn addition to its mRNA next generation CRC screening test,\\xa0Mainz\\xa0Biomed\\xa0is also developing PancAlert for an easy and convenient at home test for pancreatic cancer.\\nTackling A\\xa0fight that modern medicine just cannot seem to win.\\nDespite its efforts to translate scientific research into effective medicines for cancer patients, Pfizer is still not near a breakthrough in oncology. Undoubtably, Pfizer is betting big on oncology to turn its ship around, which it showed with the\\xa0$43 billion acquisition of the cancer drugmaker Seagen. With the combined pipeline,\\xa0Pfizer is hoping to produce at least eight blockbuster medicines by the end of the decade. But this is still only a promise while\\xa0cancer remains one of the most complex diseases of the modern civilization and one of science’s biggest challenges. Only time will show if mRNA technology is the missing piece of the puzzle for science to finally win the cancer battle.

Following the news, the stock gained 5.4% on Monday and continued to gain another 2.5% in the after-market hours.\\nPer the data readout, treatment with ARCT-154 showed a stronger and longer-lasting immune response compared with that achieved with the conventional mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty, developed jointly by Pfizer PFE and BioNTech SE\\xa0BNTX, for up to a year in both younger and older adults. This effectiveness was observed against the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, Omicron BA.4-5, and other variants, using just one-sixth of the dosage strength of PFE/BNTX’s Comirnaty (5 μg vs 30 μg).\\nArcturus and CSL shared additional data demonstrating that their bivalent vaccine, ARCT-2301, built on the same platform as ARCT-154, also provides stronger and longer-lasting immune responses compared with PFE/BNTX’s Comirnaty. This enhanced immunity persists for up to six months after vaccination against key variants.\\nYear to date, shares of Arcturus have plunged 26.4% compared with the industry’s 1.8% decline.\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\nManagement emphasized the importance of vaccines that offer longer-lasting protection, citing the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of new variants. Per the company, these new data readouts demonstrate the potential of sa-mRNA vaccines to provide strong and extended protection against COVID-19.\\nPlease note that in Japan, ARCT-154 first received approval in November 2023 as the first sa-mRNA\\xa0COVID-19 vaccine for initial vaccination and booster for adults aged 18 years and older. Recently, the regulatory body in Japan also approved/authorized the updated formulation of the sa-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine under the brand name, Kostaive, targeting the variant JN.1 for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and above. A regulatory filing for Kostaive to treat the same indication is also currently under review in the EU.\\nThe FDA, on Aug. 22, approved/authorized the updated mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines of\\xa0Pfizer/BioNTech\\xa0and\\xa0Moderna\\xa0MRNA that target the KP.2 strain of the virus.\\nWhile the agency approved Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty and Moderna’s Spikevax for use in individuals aged 12 years and older, it granted emergency use authorization to low-dose formulations of these vaccines for use in individuals aged six months through 11 years. These approvals/authorizations are based on a combination of manufacturing, non-clinical and real-world data, which supported the efficacy and safety of the updated Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.\\nEarlier this month, Moderna announced that the advisory committee to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\\xa0has rendered a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Spikevax to target the variant JN.1 for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 in individuals aged six months and above. Moderna’s Spikevax, targeting the variant JN.1, is currently approved in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Taiwan.\\nLast week, Pfizer and BioNTech also announced that EMA’s advisory committee has recommended the marketing authorization for their updated formulation of\\xa0Comirnaty, which targets the currently circulating KP.2 strain of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, for individuals aged six months and above. The European Commission had earlier authorized the Omicron JN.1-adapted COVID-19 vaccine in July 2024, which is also approved in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Taiwan.\\nArcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. price-consensus-chart | Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. Quote\\nApart from ARCT-154 and ARCT-2301, Arcturus, in partnership with CSL, is developing innovative mRNA vaccines.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA cleared the company’s investigational new drug (IND) application for its product candidate, ARCT-032, which is being developed for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). Following the FDA clearance of the IND, Arcturus will now begin a phase II multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ARCT-032 in people with CF.\\nARCT-032 is developed using the company’s proprietary Lunar lipid-mediated aerosolized platform, which follows a novel mechanism of action. The FDA has previously granted an Orphan Drug designation and Rare Pediatric Disease designation to ARCT-032 for the treatment of CF.\\nThe company is developing another pipeline candidate, ARCT-810, in a phase II study for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.\\nArcturus’ top line currently comprises collaboration revenues from partners and grant revenues. Successful development of these candidates should boost the company’s growth prospects.\\nArcturus currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Vaccine makers and analysts alike are still unclear about what a new fall respiratory virus market looks like in a post-pandemic world. But low uptake this season is, so far, in line with expectations.\n",
      "Fewer COVID-19 and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccines have been administered this year than were administered around the same time last year, according to a note from Jefferies analyst Michael Yee on Friday.\n",
      "That includes COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), which have totaled about 2.5 million doses administered weekly as of Oct. 4, up slightly from 2.4 million the week before. Meanwhile, doses of RSV vaccines, which include shots from Pfizer, Moderna, and GSK (GSK), are down 40% year over year.\n",
      "COVID jabs started strong at the end of August but slowed recently. Wall Street is waiting to see if there is any pickup by the holidays or if they continue to dwindle — which would signal poor sales for the year for both Moderna and Pfizer. There have been roughly 2.5 million prescriptions written for COVID vaccines, with Moderna comprising 1 million and Pfizer at 1.5 million.\n",
      "Investors have been closely watching vaccine sales in the post-pandemic era to understand if they will continue to contribute significantly to manufacturers' bottom lines and at what level they will bottom out.\n",
      "Moderna has faced the most scrutiny as it pivots away from being a single-product company, with two vaccines on the market.\n",
      "But Jefferies noted that Moderna's vaccine market share is \"immaterial\" for RSV vaccines, as it holds less than 1% of the market. And for the COVID market, its share is about 40%, which is less than the 48% it enjoyed last year.\n",
      "Moderna was the first company to prove the mRNA technology worked during the pandemic. It recorded nearly $38 billion in sales from the COVID vaccine in 2021 and 2022 before a decline to just $6.8 billion last year. This is the company's first RSV season, which lasts from September through April and typically peaks by February.\n",
      "The RSV market was expected to be weaker this year than last year, which was the first season with shots on the market.\n",
      "Yee wrote that the firm had predicted RSV jabs would be about 15%-20% lower than in 2023 — which had $2 billion in sales and about 10 million shots administered. The prediction for 2024 was for around 8 million shots.\n",
      "But six weeks into the season, there have only been 900,000 prescriptions so far, compared to 1.5 million in the same period last year, representing a 40% year-over-year decline.\n",
      "Investors will be waiting to see if the three companies shift their 2024 outlook in upcoming earnings calls.\n",
      "\"There is some debate that as we enter the second year of the endemic we will see lower covid jabs in this season too, which we do expect based off commentary on demand,\" Yee wrote. \"We also saw MRNA share lower 2025 guidance and co is alluding to assumptions around lower vaccination rates in 2025.\"\n",
      "Moderna reduced its 2024 outlook from $4 billion in sales to between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Pfizer, meanwhile, raised its outlook earlier this year after several cost-cutting moves. It now expects revenue in the range of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion, up from $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion — with a combined $8.5 billion expected from the COVID vaccine and COVID treatment Paxlovid.\n",

      "**Moderna, Inc. (MRNA)**, as analyzed from the data spanning from December 2018, has presented a mixture of stability and volatility typical of a biotech company, especially in its early stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Market Interest**: The significant trading volumes highlight strong investor interest and liquidity.\n",
      "2. **Volatility**: Early volatility may indicate potential for high returns if timed correctly by investors.\n",
      "3. **High Growth Potential**: As a biotech firm, especially one involved in mRNA technology, Moderna has high growth potential, mainly driven by advancements in healthcare and biotechnology sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Weaknesses:\n",
      "1. **Lack of Dividends**: The absence of dividends may be a drawback for income-focused investors.\n",
      "2. **Volatility Risk**: The stock’s significant price fluctuations present risks, especially for risk-averse investors.\n",
      "3. **Market Sensitivity**: The biotech sector is highly sensitive to regulatory news, clinical trial results, and competitor actions, introducing an element of unpredictability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alignment with Investment Strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Growth-Oriented Investors**: If the client's investment strategy is focused on capitalizing on high-growth potential investments, Moderna is a suitable candidate. The biotech sector, and Moderna in particular, could offer substantial returns, especially with successful product developments.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Risk-Averse Investors**: If the client prioritizes stability and lower risk, they might want to be cautious. Given the stock’s volatility and market sensitivity, it may not align well with a conservative investment strategy.\n",

      "- **Income-Focused Investors**: Since Moderna currently doesn’t offer dividends, it might not fit if the client's strategy relies on dividend income.\n",

      "\n",
      "Considering the given data and potential growth prospects, I recommend Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) for clients with a higher risk tolerance and a focus on future growth rather than immediate returns. This stock aligns well with a growth strategy but might require diversification to mitigate inherent risks.\n",

      "Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN), the telecom company formerly known as CenturyLink, seemed to be in dire straits just a few years ago. Its revenue was declining, it was racking up steep losses, and it suspended its dividend in 2022.\n",
      "But over the past 12 months, Lumen's stock soared 374% as a new AI infrastructure deal with Microsoft breathed fresh life into its business. Could those tailwinds propel its stock even higher over the next year?\n",
      "Lumen is one of the largest wireline service providers in the United States. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, which expanded their wireless networks to reduce their dependence on wireline connections, Lumen shunned the wireless market and expanded its wireline business through a series of mergers and acquisitions.\n",
      "Lumen expected to generate slow but steady growth as economies of scale kicked in. It also expanded its faster fiber networks and bundled more cloud, security, and collaboration services into its business wireline plans.\n",
      "Lumen's smaller fiber business grew, but that growth was offset by the persistent decline of its business wireline segment. As a result, its annual revenue fell for the past five consecutive years. Over the past two years, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins shrank and it racked up steep losses.\n",

      "That's why Lumen's stock dropped below $1 this June. But in July, its stock soared after Microsoft, which owns Azure, the world's second largest cloud infrastructure platform, signed a new networking and fiber deal with Lumen. Through that partnership, Lumen will upgrade Azure's infrastructure to support the future growth of its cloud and AI services. Lumen also signed a deal with Corning to secure a steady supply of fiber optic cables for those sweeping upgrades.\n",
      "In early August, Lumen claimed it had secured $5 billion in new contracts (including the Microsoft deal) related to the AI connectivity market. It also said it was in \"active discussions\" to \"secure another $7 billion in sales opportunities\" and would aim to \"more than double its intercity network miles over the next five years.\"\n",
      "Based on those statements, Lumen could potentially generate $5 to $12 billion in revenue over the next five years ($1 to $2.4 billion annually) from its new AI-related contracts. That would be equivalent to 7% to 16% of its revenue in 2023, but it's unclear if those tailwinds can fully offset the secular decline of its non-AI business wireline segment.\n",
      "Analysts expect Lumen's revenue to decline 11% to $13 billion in 2024, followed by a milder 4% dip to $12.4 billion in 2025 as the macro environment warms up, it expands its fiber business, and it recognizes more revenue from its AI contracts.\n",
      "However, Lumen plans to \"pull forward\" some of its planned spending for 2026 and 2027 to 2025 to fulfill those new AI data center deals. As a result, it expects its adjusted EBITDA to decline from $4.6 billion in 2023 to $3.9 to $4 billion in 2024. Analysts expect its adjusted EBITDA to drop to $3.9 billion in 2024 and slip to $3.7 billion in 2025.\n",
      "Those lackluster expectations indicate Lumen's business won't experience a rapid recovery over the next year. It's also still saddled with $18.4 billion in long-term debt and a staggering debt-to-equity ratio of 70. However, it expects its new contracts to boost its free cash flow (FCF) from negative $878 million in 2023 to positive $1 to $1.2 billion in 2024. It also still had $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of its latest quarter.\n",
      "Lumen won't go bankrupt anytime soon, and its stock still looks undervalued relative to its peers. With an enterprise value of $23.4 billion (which includes all of its long-term debt), it trades at just 1.8 times this year's sales and 6 times its adjusted EBITDA. By the same measure, AT&T and Verizon trade at 6.3 and 6.8 times this year's sales, respectively.\n",
      "Yet Lumen's stock can only be considered cheap if it actually grows its revenue, keeps its FCF positive, and turns profitable again. We probably won't know if it can achieve all of those goals within the next four quarters.\n",
      "So for now, I expect Lumen's stock to mainly trade on the short-term news regarding its AI-oriented businesses and the broader AI market. Its downside potential might be limited by investors' hopes for its future growth, but its upside potential could also be capped by concerns about its persistent losses, shrinking margins, and high debt. Therefore, I still expect Lumen's stock to trade sideways and likely underperform its more profitable industry peers over the next year.\n",
